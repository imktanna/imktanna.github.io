        <h1>PANGARCHULLA TREK</h1>
        <img src="pangarchulla1.jpg" class="image1" >
        <H2>
            OVERVIEW
        </H2>
        <ul class="over">
            <li>Region :- Uttarakhand </li>
            <li>Duration :- 7 Days </li>
            <li>Grade :- Moderate To Difficult </li>
            <li>Max Altitude :- 14,700 Ft. </li>
            <li>Approx Trekking Km :- 44 Kms. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="con1">Adorning the Lord Curzon circuit- one of Garhwal Himalaya’s most fabled trails, Pangarchulla- the chimney peak soars to vision. Perched at 14, 700 ft., for mountaineering enthusiasts, the peak offers a perfect test of non-technical climbing skills. Though this Uttarakhand trek is accessible all though the year, it is the winter snow that makes it truly unsurpassable. If thrill is directly proportionate to the gauge of challenge, Pangarchulla Peak Trek in the winters would be a journey brave hearts just cannot afford to miss!</p>
        <p class="con1">Spanning over 7 days, the trek will take you along the pilgrim vein of Uttarakhand, from Haridwar to Joshimath, where we have our base camp. A little further away, from Dhak village, starts our walking trajectory up the rocky tracks. With ascent, the horizons open up to cliff side villages characterized by terraced farmland and slant roofed houses, moving on to green meadows surrounded by the signature peaks of Garhwal Himalayas. Notable are—Nanda Devi, Chaukhamba, Hati-Ghori, and Barmal among others. Part of the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, the trail to Pangarchulla never loses sight of these celebrated peaks and culminates finally at the summit with a gala of glittering snow views.</p>
