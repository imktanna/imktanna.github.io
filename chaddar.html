        <h1>CHADAR TREK</h1>
        <img src="chadar1.jpg" class="image1">
        <H2>
            OVERVIEW
        </H2>
        <ul class="over">
            <li>Region :- Leh, Ladakh, J & K  </li>
            <li>Duration :- 9 Days </li>
            <li>Grade :- Difficult </li>
            <li>Max Altitude :- 11,100 Ft. </li>
            <li>Approx Trekking Km :- 62 Kms. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="con1">The journey starts at the mountain town of Leh. The only way to reach Leh is by flight and it is surrounded by snow giving it a complete white look. One can catch a glimpse of the snow capped mountains from the flight as it descends toward Leh which is located at 11400 feet above sea level. The trek is over the Zanskar River which lies frozen during the winter. The most preferred time to cross the ice would be in February. During that time, the ice tends to be at its most stable state. The Frozen River Trek begins from the small village of Chilling from where the Zanskar River begins to freeze.</p>
        <p class="con1">The ice can be as dangerous at times as it can be safe during others. One needs to figure out the safe paths over the precarious sheet and must always be aware of the ice conditions below the feet. The trekkers can choose to camp in the caves along the banks like the locals or set up tents where the ice is the most stable. The setting is close to twenty degrees below freezing point and decreases further after sundown as well. Warm and layered clothes are recommended as is being on the move as much as possible. These help invariably in keeping the body warm and prevent cold sores and also keep the blood from freezing.</p>
